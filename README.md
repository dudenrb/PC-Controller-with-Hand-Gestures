# PC-Controller-with-Hand-Gestures
 The objective of PC Controller with Hand Gestures is to develop a contactless, intuitive,
 and efficient input system that allows users to control computer functions through hand
 gestures. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning technologies, the project aims
 to replace traditional input devices like the mouse with a gesture-based alternative, improving
 accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities and enhancing user interaction across
 various domains. The system is designed to be both practical and adaptable, showcasing the
 potential for widespread applications in industries such as gaming, virtual reality, healthcare,
 and robotics.
